## Overview
This repository contains the frontend code for the Todo Application, a web application designed for efficient task management. It's built using React and integrates with a backend API for full functionality.

## Purpose
The frontend of the Todo Application showcases modern web development techniques with a focus on:
- Creating interactive and responsive user interfaces with React.
- Consuming RESTful APIs for dynamic data handling.
- Implementing modern JavaScript practices and using React features effectively.
- Demonstrating CI/CD principles using GitHub and Vercel for continuous integration and deployment.

## Features
- Interactive UI for managing tasks (create, view, update, delete).
- Responsive design for optimal experience across different devices.
- Integration with the backend API for real-time data processing.

## Technologies Used
- React
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- [Other Libraries/Frameworks used in the project]

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Access to the backend API (See the backend repository for setup)

### Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository directory]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
The application is configured for CI/CD with Vercel. Any commits to the `main` branch trigger an automatic build and deployment process.

## CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline for this project is set up to streamline development and deployment processes using GitHub and Vercel:

- **GitHub Integration**: The repository is integrated with GitHub, enabling version control and collaborative development.
- **Automated Deployments with Vercel**: The application is connected to Vercel, which automatically deploys the latest version of the main branch.
- **Build Configuration**: On every commit to the main branch, Vercel automatically builds and deploys the application. The build settings are configured in Vercel to align with the project requirements.
- **Environment Management**: Environment variables and project settings are managed through Vercel's dashboard, ensuring that the production build aligns with the desired configuration.

This setup ensures that every push to the main branch is automatically and reliably deployed, maintaining a consistent state of the live application.


## Learning Outcomes
- Gained experience in building and deploying a React application.
- Learned to integrate frontend applications with RESTful APIs.
- Understood the principles and practices of CI/CD in a real-world project setting.
